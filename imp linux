Hereâ€™s a concrete guide to where and how Linux is used in DevOps/SRE, with real-time responsibilities, commands, examples, and interview questions/answers focused on your 3.5+ years experience:

âœ… Linux Usage in DevOps/SRE â€“ Real-Time Areas
Area	Description	Real-time Tasks	Key Commands
1. System Monitoring	Track system performance & resource usage	CPU/memory load check, disk usage, top processes	top, htop, vmstat, iostat, df, free
2. Log Management	Debug & trace system/app errors	Check logs, rotate logs, forward logs	journalctl, tail -f, grep, logrotate
3. Service/Process Management	Start/stop app services, manage daemons	Restart services, check status, enable boot	systemctl, ps -ef, kill, netstat, ss
4. File & Permission Management	File ownership, permissions & security	Secure sensitive files, set correct permissions	chmod, chown, ls -l, umask
5. Automation (Shell Scripting)	Repeated task automation	Backup, cleanup, deployment scripts	bash, cron, awk, sed, if/else, loops
6. Networking	Debug connections, DNS, ports	Firewall rules, ping, DNS test, port scan	ping, dig, telnet, curl, nc, iptables
7. User Management	Add/remove users, manage sudo	Least privilege, auditing, SSH access	useradd, passwd, visudo, id, groups
8. Storage & Mounts	Manage disks, mount volumes	Check disk space, mount/unmount drives	mount, umount, lsblk, fdisk, df -h
9. SSH & Remote Access	Securely access VMs & nodes	Setup key-based SSH, troubleshoot access	ssh, scp, rsync, ~/.ssh/config
10. Security & Hardening	Secure OS, disable unused services	Configure firewalls, disable root SSH, audit	ufw, fail2ban, auditd, chkconfig

ðŸŽ¯ SRE/DevOps Interview Questions & Answers â€“ Linux Focus
âœ… Q1: How do you check memory usage and which process is consuming the most?
A:

bash
Copy
Edit
free -m          # shows RAM usage  
top              # shows top memory-consuming processes  
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
âœ… Q2: How do you debug high CPU usage on a Linux server?
A:

Use top or htop to identify top CPU-consuming processes.

Use pidstat -u -p <PID> to get CPU usage per PID.

Use nice/renice or kill to manage high CPU tasks.

âœ… Q3: How do you schedule a log cleanup job every 7 days?
A:
Use a cron job:

bash
Copy
Edit
0 2 */7 * * /usr/bin/find /var/log/myapp/ -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \;
âœ… Q4: How do you restart a failed systemd service and check its logs?
A:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl status nginx
journalctl -u nginx --since "1 hour ago"
âœ… Q5: Whatâ€™s the difference between chmod 755 and chmod 644?
A:

755: rwxr-xr-x â†’ owner can read/write/execute, others can read & execute.

644: rw-r--r-- â†’ owner can read/write, others can only read.

âœ… Q6: How would you automate SSH-based log sync from multiple VMs?
A:
Use rsync + key-based SSH + shell script with loop:

bash
Copy
Edit
for server in vm1 vm2 vm3; do
  rsync -avz -e ssh /var/logs/ user@$server:/backup/logs/
done
âœ… Q7: How do you troubleshoot if a port is blocked or not listening?
A:

bash
Copy
Edit
netstat -tuln | grep <port>
ss -tuln | grep <port>
telnet <host> <port>
âœ… Q8: How do you ensure your Linux servers are secure?
A:

Disable root SSH login (/etc/ssh/sshd_config)

Use key-based authentication.

Close unused ports with ufw or iptables.

Set up log monitoring & intrusion detection (e.g. fail2ban, auditd).

ðŸ“Œ DevOps/SRE Resume Summary â€“ Linux Bullet Points
Automated daily log backups using shell scripts and rsync.

Monitored CPU and memory metrics using top, vmstat, and alerts.

Developed health check scripts and integrated with monitoring tools.

Hardened Linux servers by disabling unused ports and services.

Debugged network and system issues using netstat, journalctl, and tcpdump.
